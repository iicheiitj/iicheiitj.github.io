              "Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE) was born on the eve of the Indian Independence during the days fomenting with nationalistic aspirations. Dr. Hira Lal Roy, the great visionary and pioneer of Chemical Engineering education in India, along with a few other stalwarts felt the need for such a forum within the country to spread Chemical Engineering education and to foster the interest of the Chemical Engineering profession in general.

              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The Institute publishes a journal, Indian Chemical Engineer (ICE), which has been the Institute’s main organ since 1959. Even before that, Transactions of Chemical Engineers was regularly published between 1948 and 1958. Presently, five issues of the journal are published in a year. The Special Issues of ICE are rich sources of information with contributions from noted academics and industry bigwigs. Extensively focusing on a topical issue in vast arena of Chemical Engineering, these are much sought after by professionals and students for future reference. Eminent professors, scientists and industry experts are associated with the journal as Editor, Associate Editors and advisors. In 2011, the Institute entered into an agreement with Taylor & Francis, the internationally renowned publishing house, for publication of ICE with a view to obtaining better impact factor for the journal and wider global reach.
